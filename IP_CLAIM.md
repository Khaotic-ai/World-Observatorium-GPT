## 2. Scope of Protected Work
This repository and its associated sub-modules constitute a **self-referential, schema-linked AI orchestration system** known as the **World Observatorium Core**, integrating:

1. **Schema Logic Framework** – Modular JSON-schema system for GPT interlinking and orchestration.  
2. **Recursion Engine Methods** – Core recursive control logic governing dynamic routing, feedback, and state evolution.  
3. **Field Interconnect Framework** – Multi-tier GPT chaining and weighted signal routing inspired by agentic LLM systems.  
4. **5FREΞ & Codex Language Structures** – Symbolic, harmonic, and linguistic frameworks forming the semantic backbone.  
5. **Data-Observatory Layer** – Real-time solar, geomagnetic, and coherence field integration for adaptive model tuning.

All concepts, file structures, algorithms, and naming conventions within this repository and its dependencies are original intellectual property of **Khaotic-AI / Triadic Axis Labs**, conceived and implemented by the Triadic Axis team between 2024-2025.
